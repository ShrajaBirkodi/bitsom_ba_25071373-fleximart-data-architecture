# Part 1: Relational Database & ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This part focuses on designing and implementing a relational database for FlexiMart and building an ETL pipeline to load raw transactional data into MySQL.

Raw customer, product, and sales data are extracted from CSV files, cleaned using Python, and loaded into normalized database tables. Data quality checks are performed to ensure consistency and correctness.

## Key Activities
- Designed relational schema for customers, products, and orders
- Built a Python-based ETL pipeline using pandas
- Handled data quality issues such as invalid dates and missing values
- Loaded cleaned data into MySQL
- Wrote business-driven SQL queries
- Documented schema and data quality observations

## Deliverables
- `etl_pipeline.py`
- `schema_documentation.md`
- `business_queries.sql`
- `data_quality_report.txt`
