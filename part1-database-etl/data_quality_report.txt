1. Built an ETL pipeline using Python and MySQL. 
The pipeline extracts raw CSV data, performs cleaning and transformation such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and then loads the cleaned data into a relational database while maintaining referential integrity.

2. Data Quality Issues Identified & Resolved
Customers Data
Duplicate customer records were identified and removed.
Missing email values were handled by allowing NULLs where applicable.
Phone numbers were standardized.
Registration dates were validated and loaded in DATE format.

Products Data
Missing prices were replaced with default values.
Missing stock quantities were set to zero.
Product categories were standardized (Electronics, Fashion, Groceries).
Duplicate product records were prevented by clearing the table before reload.

Sales Data
Duplicate transactions were removed.
Mixed date formats were standardized to YYYY-MM-DD during transformation.
Invalid foreign key references were resolved by assigning a valid surrogate customer key.
Total order amount was calculated as quantity × unit_price.

3. ETL Execution Strategy
Target tables were cleared in a foreign-key-safe order (orders → products → customers).
Data was loaded sequentially: customers, products, then sales.
Referential integrity was maintained throughout the process.

4. Final Load Summary
Customers loaded: 25
Products loaded: 20
Orders loaded: 41

The ETL pipeline executed successfully with all data quality issues addressed.
