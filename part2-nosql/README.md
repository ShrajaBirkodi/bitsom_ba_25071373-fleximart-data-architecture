# Part 2: NoSQL Data Modeling & MongoDB Analytics

## Overview
This part explores NoSQL data modeling using MongoDB for flexible and scalable product analytics. Product data is stored in JSON format and queried using MongoDB aggregation pipelines.

MongoDB is used to perform category-level analysis, price-based filtering, and insights that are difficult to model efficiently in relational databases.

## Key Activities
- Imported product catalog data into MongoDB
- Designed document-based data structure
- Performed aggregation queries for product analysis
- Compared NoSQL and relational approaches for analytics
- Documented insights and observations

## Deliverables
- `products_catalog.json`
- `mongodb_operations.js`
- `nosql_analysis.md`
